Notes for public release of the fastNLO_toolkit package version 2.5.0, tag 2826
===============================================================================
The major developments included in this release are:
- This release contains numerous updates from the development of grid productions for
  NNLO calculations using the APPLfast interface (nnlo-bridge) to the NNLOJET program.
  - In particular, the new grid format v2.5 allows additional information on the
    numerical precision for each fixed-order contribution to be contained directly
    within the grid in so-called InfoBlocks. The evaluation code is backwards compatible,
    but new v2.5 grids require at least this release.
  - The executable fnlo-tk-modify has been updated such that information on the
    numerical precision can be added to the final interpolation grid directly from
    NNLOJET dat files, log files produced by fnlo-tk-statunc from samples of e.g.
    grids filled by NLOJet++, or from text files containing the relative
    uncertainty. Details on which and how such modifications are configured, can
    be found in share/fastnlo_toolkit/modify/SteerModify.str
  - A printout of the relative statistical uncertainty can be achieved using
    'fnlo-tk-yodaout grid.tab.gz PDF ST order'
    See 'fnlo-tk-yodaout -h' for more options.
- The publically accessible fastNLO repository has been migrated to the
  gitlab server at KIT:
  https://gitlab.etp.kit.edu/qcd-public/fastNLO
  The Toolkit code can be found in the subdirectory v2.5/toolkit
  and the exact release can be cloned by checking out the corresponding tag.
  Note, however, that in order to install from a git checkout autotools and
  compilers etc. must be available. Before doing a 'make -j cores install'
  the steps of 'autoreconf -i' and './configure --prefix=/path/to/installation further options'
  must be successful.
  Some useful scripts can be found in tools and tools/plotting. Notably, fnlosrc_install.csh
  might help to install a whole set of software packages. Run './fnlosrc_install.csh' without
  options for more info.
- On suggestion by D. Kalinkin the pyext code has been updated to support fastNLOreader
  subclasses for using custom PDFs.



Notes for public prerelease of the fastNLO_toolkit package version 2.3.1pre, revision 2402:
=================================================================================================
Some major new developments are included in this release:
(Attention: compiler with C++11 support is mandatory!)
- In preparation of grid productions for NNLO calculations, many new features have been
  implemented with respect to fastNLO table mass production and their statistical combination.
  In particular, these are
  - usage of the nnlo-bridge package (to be released) for filling fastNLO or APPLgrid
    interpolation grids from NNLOJET
  - extension of the fastNLO table format (2.36.00, backwards compatible) to store
    statistical weight information for many new merging options addressing
    statistical fluctuations in NNLO grid productions
  - steering-less initialisation possible in addition to steering files
  - improved warmup file generation and check
  - more options for distribution of x nodes
- Support of transparent writing/reading of gzipped tables tab.gz to reduce significantly
  the necessary disk space when storing large numbers of tables;
  requires the zlib compression library to be present;
- Includes new test suite to check installation --> 'make check'
- Includes basic example for a bi-directional interface between
  the C++ fastNLO toolkit and Fortran analysis / PDF fitting code (fortranext)
- The fastNLO table evaluation part is mostly unchanged, but has been
  complemented with more tools to manipulate tables like
  - cutting out unused bins or multiplying bins by a set of factors (fnlo-tk-modify)
  - concatenating separately calculated phase-space bins into one common table (fnlo-tk-cat)
  - printing out normalised cross sections directly for tables set up with normalisation flag
    (fnlo-tk-cppread, fnlo-tk-yodaout)
  - printing out partial cross sections for crosschecks, e.g. NLO contribution alone,
    or of cross section for all members of a PDF set (fnlo-tk-cppread)
  - new merger with many new options for table combination (fnlo-tk-merge2)
- Issue reported by D. Maitre fixed
- Some issues in Python wrapper fixed



Notes for public prerelease of the fastNLO_toolkit package version 2.3.1pre, revision 2212:
=================================================================================================
Some little issues fixed and:
- Add producer for ROOT files with xsections & uncertainties.
- Added executable fnlo-tk-statunc to derive statistical uncertainty from
  sample of calculations with equal weight.
- Installation adapted to new autotools-enabled QCDNUM versions.
  Old-style QCDNUM versions not supported anymore.
- Some adaptations for use in newer xFitter version.
- Some adaptations for use with mcgrid 2.0.



Notes for public prerelease of the fastNLO_toolkit package version 2.3.1pre, revision 2163:
=================================================================================================
Some little issues fixed and:
- PDF uncertainties calculable via fastNLO code or via LHAPDF6 (both not for HERAPDF).
  A struct with 3 vectors is returned giving x section and rel. lower and upper uncertainty.
- fnlo-tk-yodaout acquired an additional option for the fixed-order to be used, def. is NLO.
- Standard table info printout now also prints no. of x nodes.
- Improvements in table checking when merging/appending.



Notes for public prerelease of the fastNLO_toolkit package version 2.3.1pre, revision 2143:
=================================================================================================
Only some little issues have been fixed and improvements incorporated into this prerelease:
- Interface part to MCgrid v2.0 finalized.
- Option "IgnoreWarmupBinningCheck" added, avoids warmup binning check if set to true
  (useful for bin borders in pi etc.).
- An example to fill ROOT histograms from within fastNLO is provided (with input from Giannis Flouris)
- Rebuild problem in Doxygen documentation is fixed.
- Improved problem catch for ill-formatted tables.
- Added some more safety measures with respect to inf or nan entries.
- Improved logging handling.



Notes for public prerelease of the fastNLO_toolkit package version 2.3.1pre, revision 2087:
=================================================================================================
Major work went into this prelease:
- This prerelease is meant to work with the next release of MCgrid (> v1.2) and Sherpa
  to include all NLO processes available via this chain.
- A new executable fnlo-tk-yodaout has been conceived (including work by Stefanos Tyros)
  that provides YODA-formatted output for inclusion of fixed-oder table evaluations
  in Data/MC comparisons via Rivet. Foreseen to be used in MCplots.
- Up to triple differential observable binnings are supported, numerous
  Getter functions are provided.
- Functionality to derive scale and PDF uncertainties has been added and is used
  in fnlo-tk-yodaout
- fnlo-tk-config executable is provided for easier compiling/linking.
- A first version of Doxygen documentation is included.
- Method added to derive scale uncertainties.
- Numerous little issues fixed



Notes for public prerelease of the fastNLO_toolkit package version 2.3.1pre, revision 1870:
=================================================================================================
Only small changes to eliminate some installation hiccups for the optional parts and
to remove some additional warnings found by the clang and icc compilers.
Don't hesitate to contact the authors for any questions or problems.



Notes for first public prerelease of the fastNLO_toolkit package version 2.3.1pre, revision 1854:
=================================================================================================
This is a prerelease for testing and numerous things are still in progress.
Proper documentation is missing.
Don't hesitate to contact the authors for any questions or problems.



Notes for very first autotools version of fastNLO_toolkit version 2.1.0, revision 1494:
=======================================================================================

- Restructured like fastNLO_reader C++ part
- src contains code for one excutable to be made
- fastnlotoolkit contains code for linkable library libfastnlotoolkit to be compiled and linked
- subdir include/fastnlotk contains header files
==> All include statements in code had to be complemented with "fastnlotk/"
==> Change in library name and fastnlotk include directory allows simultaneous
    installation and use of reader library AND toolkit library without problems
    caused by identically named header files
