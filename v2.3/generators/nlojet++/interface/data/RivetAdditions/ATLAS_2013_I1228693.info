Description:
This paper reports the measurement of inclusive jet cross sections in proton-proton collisions at a
centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV using a data sample of integrated luminosity of 0.20 pb-1 collected in 2011.
Jets are identified using the anti-kt algorithm with two radius parameters (0.4 and 0.6). The cross sections are
presented as a function of the jet transverse momentum and rapidity covering jets from 20-430 GeV in transverse momentum
and |rapidity| < 4.4. The data are also compared with previous ATLAS 7 TeV cross sections as functions of PT and XT.
The main tables below show the results correlated and uncorrelated systematic errors individually combined, as presented
in the plots in the paper. The first table below gives access to the complete tables with the various sources of
systematic error individually presented. Correlations over the rapidity bins and to the 7 TeV data are shown in table 1
of the paper and repeated below.
