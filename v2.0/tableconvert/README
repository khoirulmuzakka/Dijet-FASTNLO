Issues with tables converted from v1.4 to v2.0
----------------------------------------------

1. The conversion has to be done using
   conv20 intable.tab scenname.tab
   to have scenname written as scenario name into the convrted table.

2. Treat the table once with tablefix.pl to trim leading and trailing
   space.

3. Standard nlofast-add'er by default always writes:
   ixsectunits = 9 which is nanobarns, check with scenario code
   NLOJET++ without version number (should be 2.0.1)
   1st dimension as "pT_in_GeV"
   2nd dimension as "y", could also be "|y|" or eta or something else 
   setprecision is 40! way too high, 17 would be sufficient
   writes leading/trailing blanks and zeros

4. Conversion doesn't work for reference tables

5. Check title strings 

6. Bug in conversion of dijet mass tables, check!!!
