fastNLO_converter version 2.1.0:
================================

Installation of distribution package:
-------------------------------------
Via autotools setup, in unpacking directory of *.tar.gz file:

./configure --prefix=your_local_directory
make -j ncores install


Requirements:
-------------
None.


Content:
--------
Fortran code to read fastNLO v1.4 tables and convert them to fastNLO v2.0


Features:
---------
Readable table content:
fastNLO v1.4 Tables may contain the following contributions
- LO QCD
- NLO QCD
- threshold corrections
  (only for inclusive jets)


Usage:
------
 # Usage: ./fnlo-convert [arguments]
 # Table input file,  def. = intable.tab
 # Table output file, def. = outtable.tab
 # Scenarioname, def. = fnx9999
 # Table part to write, def. = 9 (all)
 #    0: Table header only
 #    1: LO contribution only
 #    2: NLO contribution only
 #    3: THC contribution only
 #    9: Complete table
 # Bin widths were not stored in v1.4 tables!
 # ==> calculate bin widths from 2-dim. binning!
 # Set additional bin width factor, def. = 1
 #   0.: Ignore all binning, bin widths = 1.
 #  -1.: Ignore bin widths of 1st dim. (y)
 #  -2.: Ignore bin widths of 2nd dim. (pT)
 #   2.: Multiply by 2,e.g. for |eta| or |y| bins
 # Cross section units, def. = read from table
 #
 # Use "_" to skip changing a default argument.


Remarks:
--------
Some issues with table conversions from v1.4 to v2.0:

1. Conversion does not work for reference tables
2. Standard nlofast-add'er by default ALWAYS writes:
   - IXSECTUNITS = 9 which is 10^-9 barns = nanobarns.
     Check the scenario code for correctness and eventually
     replace the value using the command line argument!
   - Writes leading/trailing blanks and zeros
3. Potentially treat the table once with fnlo-convert-fix.pl to
   trim leading and trailing space.
4. Bug in conversion of dijet mass tables? Check!!!


Usage of fnlo-convert-fix.pl:
-----------------------------
fnlo-convert-fix.pl
Usage: fnlo-convert-fix.pl table file
  -h              Print this text
  -n              Name of cleaned table (def.="oldname".new)
  -r              Replace old table by new one
                  No further options available


For maintainers only: Preparation of distribution package:
----------------------------------------------------------
autoreconf --install
./configure --prefix=your_install_directory
make distcheck

Note: configure only terminates properly if mandatory requirements
are fulfilled even if this configuration is not foreseen to be installed!
