fastNLO_converter version 2.1.0:
================================

Installation of distribution package:
-------------------------------------
Via autotools setup, in unpacking directory of *.tar.gz file:

./configure --prefix=your_local_directory
make
make install


Requirements:
-------------
None.


Content:
--------
Fortran code to read fastNLO v1.4 tables and convert them to fastNLO v2.0


Features:
---------
Readable table content:
fastNLO v1.4 Tables may contain the following contributions
- LO QCD
- NLO QCD
- threshold corrections
  (only for inclusive jets)

Usage: ./fnlo-convert [arguments]
Table input file, def. = intable.tab
Table output file, def. = outtable.tab
Scenarioname, def. = fnx9999
Table part to write, def. = 9 (all)
   0: Table header only
   1: LO contribution only
   2: NLO contribution only
   3: THC contribution only
   9: Complete table
Bin width factor, def. = 1
      Set to 2 for |eta| or |y| bins
Cross section units, def. = read from table

Use "_" to skip changing a default argument.

Some issues with tables converted from v1.4 to v2.0:

1. Conversion does not work for reference tables
2. Standard nlofast-add'er by default ALWAYS writes:
   - IXSECTUNITS = 9 which is 10^-9 barns = nanobarns.
     Check the scenario code for correctness and eventually
     replace the value using the command line argument!
   - Writes leading/trailing blanks and zeros
3. Potentially treat the table once with tablefix.pl to
   trim leading and trailing space.
4. Bug in conversion of dijet mass tables? Check!!!


For maintainers only: Preparation of distribution package:
----------------------------------------------------------
autoreconf --install
./configure --prefix=your_install_directory
make dist

Note: configure only terminates properly if mandatory requirements
are fulfilled even if this configuration is not foreseen to be installed!
