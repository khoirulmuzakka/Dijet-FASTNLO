# fastNLO_toolkit version 2.1.3pre:
# =================================
# This is a prerelease for testing!
# Please contact the authors for any questions or problems.


# Content:
# --------
# Generic C++ linkable library and code to create, fill, read, and evaluate fastNLO v2 tables


# Requirements:
# -------------
# For installation of toolkit package: LHAPDF version 5 or 6, see also http://lhapdf.hepforge.org
# For running executable: fastNLO table, PDF set from LHAPDF, see also http://fastnlo.hepforge.org


# Basic installation of distribution package fastnlo_toolkit-v.v.v-nnnn.tar.gz in six simple steps:
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Unpack distribution tarball in directory of your choice:
tar xzvf fastnlo_toolkit-v.v.v-nnnn.tar.gz
#
# 2. Descend into created subdirectory:
cd fastnlo_toolkit-v.v.v-nnnn

# 3. Configure the installation:
#    (Prepared using the GNU autotools setup, which is NOT required for the installation itself.)
./configure --prefix=/path/to/your/local/installation_directory

#    If the same installation directory or other system-wide known installation directories
#    contain already a version of LHAPDF version 5 or 6, LHAPDF will be found and used
#    automatically.
#    If not, please specify the path to where LHAPDF is installed, i.e. where
#    'bin/lhapdf-config' can be found:
./configure --prefix=/path/to/your/local/installation_directory --with-lhapdf=/path/to/your/lhapdf/installation

#    To see all available configure options do:
./configure --help

# 4. Compile and link the project, use the '-j n' option to specify,
#    how many cores, e.g. n=2, should be used in parallel in this step:
make -j n

# 5. Not yet implemented, please skip! Run functionality test suite:
#make check

# 6. Install the products into the configured target directory:
make install


# Optional features:
# ------------------
# 1. The fastNLO_toolkit supports multiple alternatives for the evolution of the strong coupling.
#    Some of them require additional external software: HOPPET and QCDNUM, see also
#    http://hoppet.hepforge.org and http://qcdnum.hepforge.org
#
#    Note: On x86_64 systems the QCDNUM libraries must be compiled with the -fPIC option.
#          Since this has to be adapted manually for each "makelibs" script in the original
#          release qcdnum-17.00.06.tar.gz, we provide an already patched version from our
#          web site: qcdnum-17.00.06-patched.tar.gz
#
#    If these packages are found in the same installation directory or
#    other system-wide known installation directories, the options
--with-hoppet
#    or
--with-qcdnum
#    can be used to support their alpha_s evolutions.
#    Otherwise their installation paths have to be specified explicitly like
--with-hoppet=/path/to/your/hoppet/installation
#    or
--with-qcdnum=/path/to/your/qcdnum/installation
#    The libraries are then expected to be in /path/to/your/installation/lib and
#    include files in /path/to/your/installation/include


# 2. There is work in progress to provide output in YODA format for comparisons to data
#    using Rivet analyses and rivet-mkhtml
--with-yoda

# 3. The fastNLO_toolkit optionally allows access to its libraries via the PYTHON scripting language.
#    If you have PYTHON and SWIG installed, the PYTHON extension can be enabled via
--enable-pyext


# Usage:
# ------
# Please see the executables in the folder 'src', e.g. run
fnlo-tk-example tablename PDF.LHgrid
# or
fnlo-tk-cppread tablename PDF.LHgrid
# for some sample cross-section print-out.
# For more details see also the description in fastnlotoolkit/fastNLOReader.cc


# For developers only:
# --------------------
# If you have the GNU autotools installed, the project gets automatically reconfigured properly
# if you e.g. add something new to a Makefile.am to be compiled or linked.
#
# The GNU autotools also support incremental installations. If you modify something in or add something
# to the fastNLO_toolkit that requires recompilation or relinking, the install step can be restricted
# to only install updated files:
make install "INSTALL=/path/to/install-sh -C"
