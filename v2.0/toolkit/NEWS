- Restructured like fastNLO_reader C++ part
- src contains code for one excutable to be made
- fastnlotoolkit contains code for linkable library libfastnlotoolkit to be compiled and linked
- subdir include/fastnlotk contains header files
==> All include statements in code had to be complemented with "fastnlotk/"
