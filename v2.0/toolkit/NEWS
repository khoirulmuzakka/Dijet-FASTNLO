Notes for public prerelease of the fastNLO_toolkit package version 2.3.1pre, revision 2212:
=================================================================================================
Some little issues fixed and:
- Add producer for ROOT files with xsections & uncertainties.
- Added executable fnlo-tk-statunc to derive statistical uncertainty from
  sample of calculations with equal weight.
- Installation adapted to new autotools-enabled QCDNUM versions.
  Old-style QCDNUM versions not supported anymore.
- Some adaptations for use in newer xFitter version.
- Some adaptations for use with mcgrid 2.0.



Notes for public prerelease of the fastNLO_toolkit package version 2.3.1pre, revision 2163:
=================================================================================================
Some little issues fixed and:
- PDF uncertainties calculable via fastNLO code or via LHAPDF6 (both not for HERAPDF).
  A struct with 3 vectors is returned giving x section and rel. lower and upper uncertainty.
- fnlo-tk-yodaout acquired an additional option for the fixed-order to be used, def. is NLO.
- Standard table info printout now also prints no. of x nodes.
- Improvements in table checking when merging/appending.



Notes for public prerelease of the fastNLO_toolkit package version 2.3.1pre, revision 2143:
=================================================================================================
Only some little issues have been fixed and improvements incorporated into this prerelease:
- Interface part to MCgrid v2.0 finalized.
- Option "IgnoreWarmupBinningCheck" added, avoids warmup binning check if set to true
  (useful for bin borders in pi etc.).
- An example to fill ROOT histograms from within fastNLO is provided (with input from Giannis Flouris)
- Rebuild problem in Doxygen documentation is fixed.
- Improved problem catch for ill-formatted tables.
- Added some more safety measures with respect to inf or nan entries.
- Improved logging handling.



Notes for public prerelease of the fastNLO_toolkit package version 2.3.1pre, revision 2087:
=================================================================================================
Major work went into this prelease:
- This prerelease is meant to work with the next release of MCgrid (> v1.2) and Sherpa
  to include all NLO processes available via this chain.
- A new executable fnlo-tk-yodaout has been conceived (including work by Stefanos Tyros)
  that provides YODA-formatted output for inclusion of fixed-oder table evaluations
  in Data/MC comparisons via Rivet. Foreseen to be used in MCplots.
- Up to triple differential observable binnings are supported, numerous
  Getter functions are provided.
- Functionality to derive scale and PDF uncertainties has been added and is used
  in fnlo-tk-yodaout
- fnlo-tk-config executable is provided for easier compiling/linking.
- A first version of Doxygen documentation is included.
- Method added to derive scale uncertainties.
- Numerous little issues fixed



Notes for public prerelease of the fastNLO_toolkit package version 2.3.1pre, revision 1870:
=================================================================================================
Only small changes to eliminate some installation hiccups for the optional parts and
to remove some additional warnings found by the clang and icc compilers.
Don't hesitate to contact the authors for any questions or problems.



Notes for first public prerelease of the fastNLO_toolkit package version 2.3.1pre, revision 1854:
=================================================================================================
This is a prerelease for testing and numerous things are still in progress.
Proper documentation is missing.
Don't hesitate to contact the authors for any questions or problems.



Notes for very first autotools version of fastNLO_toolkit version 2.1.0, revision 1494:
=======================================================================================

- Restructured like fastNLO_reader C++ part
- src contains code for one excutable to be made
- fastnlotoolkit contains code for linkable library libfastnlotoolkit to be compiled and linked
- subdir include/fastnlotk contains header files
==> All include statements in code had to be complemented with "fastnlotk/"
==> Change in library name and fastnlotk include directory allows simultaneous
    installation and use of reader library AND toolkit library without problems
    caused by identically named header files
