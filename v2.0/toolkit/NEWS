Notes for very first autotools version of fastNLO_toolkit version 2.1.0, revision 1494:
=======================================================================================

- Restructured like fastNLO_reader C++ part
- src contains code for one excutable to be made
- fastnlotoolkit contains code for linkable library libfastnlotoolkit to be compiled and linked
- subdir include/fastnlotk contains header files
==> All include statements in code had to be complemented with "fastnlotk/"
==> Change in library name and fastnlotk include directory allows simultaneous
    installation and use of reader library AND toolkit library without problems
    caused by identically named header files
