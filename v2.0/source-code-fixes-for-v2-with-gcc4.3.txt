LHAPDF-5.7.0:
-------------

Correct wrong include statement
#include "LHAPDF/LHAPDFConfig.h"
in lhapdf-5.7.0/include/LHAPDF/LHAPDF.h to
#include "LHAPDFConfig.h"

The fix has been put into the archive
lhapdf-5.7.0-fix.tar.gz



NLOJet++-4.0.1:
---------------

Add includes missing due to header dependency cleanup in
C++ with gcc-4.3, see
http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/porting_to.html 

Includes of <cstdlib>, <cstring> and <typeinfo> were
added to the following files:

nlojet++-4.0.1/nlo-core/bits/mkbuset.cc
nlojet++-4.0.1/nlo-core/bits/mkburesult.cc
nlojet++-4.0.1/src/main_calc.cc
nlojet++-4.0.1/src/main_add.cc

The fixes have been collected into the archive
nlojet++-4.0.1-fix.tar.gz



LHPDF-1.0.0:
------------

Some f77 "WRITE" statements with just "I" as format specifier
had to replaced with "I10" to give an explicit length.
In addition, one expression with
      some calc +
      -2.* ....
has been corrected to
      some calc +
      (-2.)* ....
to make the compiler happy.

The concerned file is
lhpdf-1.0.0/lhpdf/f77-qcdnum.f

and has been put into the archive
lhpdf-1.0.0-fix.tar.gz



fastNLO:
--------

Changes due to gcc-4.3 incompatibility:

Add #include <cstdlib> to
/common fnloTable.cc, fnloBlockB.cc, fnloBlockBNlojet.cc
/merger main.cc

Change
// int main(int argc,void** argv)
int main(int argc, char** argv)
in 
merger main.cc

My (KR) changes to get something running:

void UserDIS::initfunc(unsigned int)
{
   // ---- Initialize event counters
   nevents = 0;
   // Set some defaults
   // KR: Change for testing
   //   if (nwrite==0) nwrite = 5000000;
   if (nwrite==0) nwrite = 5000;

   // KR: Avoid seg faults, initialize table here and not only in
   //     UserDIS::phys_output where it seems to be too late ?
   std::cout << "   before inittable   " << endl;
   inittable();
   std::cout << "   after inittable   " << endl;

void UserDIS::inittable(){

   const bool doReference = true;
   // KR: Workaround since I couldn't figure out how the filename setting
   //     could work with inittable() in initfunc
   string tablefilename = "fastNLO.tab";
