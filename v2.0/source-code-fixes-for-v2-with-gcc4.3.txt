LHPDF-1.0.0:
------------

Some f77 "WRITE" statements with just "I" as format specifier
had to replaced with "I10" to give an explicit length.
In addition, one expression with
      some calc +
      -2.* ....
has been corrected to
      some calc +
      (-2.)* ....
to make the compiler happy.

The concerned file is
lhpdf-1.0.0/lhpdf/f77-qcdnum.f

and has been put into the archive
lhpdf-1.0.0-fix.tar.gz
