Release Notes for fastnlo_interface_nlojet version 2.3.1pre revision 2067:
==========================================================================
Updated to work with new toolkit prerelease.
Major simplification in NLOJet++ usage:
- Typical jet analyses are categorized into two classes, InclusiveNJets and
  InlusiveNJetsEvent, such that many variations can be made by only adapting
  the provided example steering files. No code changes necessary.
  InclusiveNJets makes one entry per jet of an event, while InlusiveNJetsEvent
  makes only one entry per event.
- Steering files to reproduce calculations for numerous published inclusive jet
  or dijet mass cross sections are provided and labelled with a fastNLO indicator
  plus the Inspire number of the corresponding publication.
