Description:
A measurement of the double-differential inclusive dijet production cross section in proton-proton collisions
at sqrt(s)=7 TeV is presented as a function of the dijet invariant mass and jet rapidity. The data correspond
to an integrated luminosity of 36 inverse picobarns, recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. The measurement
covers the dijet mass range 0.2 TeV to 3.5 TeV and jet rapidities up to |y|=2.5. It is found to be in
good agreement with next-to-leading-order QCD predictions.
