Description:
Measurements of the differential cross sections for inclusive jet and dijet production in proton-proton collisions
at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. Using a data sample of integrated luminosity of 5 fb-1, inclusive jet PT
cross sections up to a PT of 2 TeV in five intervals of |rapidity| from 0 to 2.5 are presented as well as
the invariant mass distributions of dijets up to a mass of 5 TeV in the 5 intervals of |rapidity|. Jets are
reconstructed using the anti-kt algorithm with distance parameter R=0.7. The cross sections are fully corrected
for detector effects.
