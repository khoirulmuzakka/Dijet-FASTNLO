  Done List for FastNLOReader
-----------------------------
- KR: Doesn't have an extra Makefile anymore. Included now in usual
      autotools setup with Makefile.am
- KR: Kicked out LHAPDF header files which should be included from
      the LHAPDF installation anyway.
- KR: Kicked out the hardwired absolute path for LHAPDF. Have
      to find better solution. Current directory is assumed now.



  ToDo List for FastNLOReader
-----------------------------

- shall we use *.cc to have it consistent with
the rest of FastNLO and nlojet++?
KR: Yes. Done.


- Implement some 'read fast' switch and 'readfast' PDFLC if
MuF is calculated using only one scale lookup table


- SetPhysUnits.
Availability of changing units afterward in pb, fb, or anything else
+ switch to differential units and divide by the bin size 
=> we would need the dimension of both variables, which define the bin grid
(like GeV and GeV^2 and 1 (for y))
-> just implement some more switch!
KR: If I understand this correctly then this exists already in v2 format.


- @MW, @KR
Please validate the:
  1) printout
KR: Unfortunately get NAN for my pp inclusive jets :-(
    In any case: Need to equalize printout of cc and f version
  2) references given when initalizing
KR: Need to equalize with f version.
  3) Comments/documentation throughout the reader
  4) Class description at the beginning *C *h files


- QCDNUM as-evolution
implement the usage of the internal qcdnum as-evolution.
KR: Not in a simple basic reader. Also requires external code ...


- Printing
Add additional printout for the cross sections, without showing the 
reference cross section!
The reference cross section is actually only valuable for the authors for 
testing and validation of the routines.


- maybe: improve the check if the table exists and 
maybe improve the error handling.
KR: Yes. And also the PDF set.


- new iostream -> do we need some 'delete iostream'??



- LHAPDF name and set
IMPORTANT!!! since LHAPDF is a singleton, you have to crosscheck if the
pdf at accessing time (when you calc xfx) is still the same as when initalizing the
fastNLO reader.
This is always true for simpel usages. But if smb might want to compare different pdfs, there
should be some cross check implemented, if you really use the correct LHAPDF.
(safe pdf-name and set for cross checks when returning and recalculating cross sections!!!)



-- future work:
restructure the code in such a way, that the SAME code/routines/classes/methods are used
for the FastNLOReader, than within common/author/creator directory.
