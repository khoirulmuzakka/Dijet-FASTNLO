Release Notes for fastNLO_reader version 2.1.0, revision 1488:
==============================================================

- Enables calculation with LO table alone or with 1-loop
  threshold corrections
- Gives consistent results between Fortran & C++ code with
  1- or 2-loop threshold corrections
- Small changes in FastNLOReader and CRunDec to avoid compilation problem
  on Mac as reported by H. Prosper
- Some rearrangement in default output, in particular for K factors
- SetContributionON now has boolean return value



Release Notes for fastNLO_reader version 2.1.0 revision 1360:
=============================================================

- To avoid the problem of an uninitialized top PDF when accessing
  ABKM09 or ABM11 PDFs via Fortran in LHAPDF (versions 5.8.7 and
  5.8.8), the top PDF has been set to zero explicitly in the Fortran
  reader. Otherwise one could observe crashes or - even worse -
  arbitrarily wrong cross sections. This problem was not found with
  the C++ reader. As a consequence some differences between the
  reader programs can show up when using a PDF set with top PDFs > 0
  like NNPDF 2.1 and scales Q > M_top.

  This problem has been fixed in LHAPDF version 5.8.9b1 such that
  the workaround could be deactivated here. Use this Fortran
  reader ONLY with LHAPDF 5.8.9b1 or later when accessing PDF sets
  ABKM09 or ABM11 !



Release Notes for fastNLO_reader version 2.1.0 revision 1354:
=============================================================

- World's end Xmas release of the fastNLO_reader package including
  experimental support for diffractive PDFs,



Release Notes for fastNLO_reader version 2.1.0 revision 1273:
=============================================================

- Pre-release of the fastNLO_reader package for the fastNLO tutorial
  at the PDF school 2012 "Proton Structure in the LHC Era" at DESY

- Updates:
  - C++ reader: Automated cache filling for alpha_s and PDFs
  - C++ reader: Added interface to CRunDec alpha_s evolution
  - C++ reader: Improved interface to LHAPDF
  - C++ reader: First implementation of verbosity levels
  - Reactivated asymmetric mu_r/mu_f scale settings in Fortran reader
  - Small inconsistency in asymmetric mu_r/mu_f scale variations between
    Fotran and C++ code fixed
  - C++ reader: Made interface to set mu_r/mu_f scales more user-friendly and less
    error prone (SetScaleFactorsMuRMuF(xmur, xmuf))
  - Default alpha_s(M_Z) value updated to PDG2012 value
  - Numerous further code improvements
  - Code documentation improved



Release Notes for fastNLO_reader version 2.1.0 revision 1062:
=============================================================

- First public release of the fastNLO_reader package

- Content:
  Generic Fortran and C++ code to read and evaluate fastNLO v2 tables
  (ATTENTION: Due to limitations in memory management with Fortran, the
              array sizes of the generic code need to be adapted to
              the investigated scenarios!
              Code dedicated to read particular scenarios (tables) can
              be made available.)
