Release Notes for fastNLO_reader version 2.1.0 revision 1062:
=============================================================

- First public release of the fastNLO_reader package

- Content:
  Generic Fortran and C++ code to read and evaluate fastNLO v2 tables
  (ATTENTION: Due to limitations in memory management with Fortran, the
              array sizes of the generic code need to be adapted to
              the investigated scenarios!
              Code dedicated to read particular scenarios (tables) can
              be made available.)
