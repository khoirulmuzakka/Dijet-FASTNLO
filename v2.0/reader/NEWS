Release Notes for fastNLO reader version 2.1.0:
-----------------------------------------------

Revision nnnn

- First public release of the fastNLO reader package

- Content:
  Generic Fortran and C++ code to read and evaluate fastNLO v2 tables
  (ATTENTION: Due to limitations in memory management with Fortran, the
              array sizes of the generic code need to be adapted to
              the investigated scenarios!
              Code dedicated to read particular scenarios (tables) can
              be made available.)

- Requirements:
  - For installation of reader package: LHAPDF
  - For running executable: fastNLO table, PDF set from LHAPDF

- Installation:
  Via autotools setup, in unpacking directory of *.tar.gz file:
  - ./configure --prefix=your_local_directory
    (should contain LHAPDF installation, otherwise specify
     separate path via --with-lhapdf=path_to_lhapdf;
     see also ./configure --help) 
  - make
  - make install

- Features:

  Observable definition:
  - Arbitrary number of dimensions for binning of observable,
    stored and printed out as one large linear array

  Scale treatment:
  Two ways of storing scale dependence:
  - Scale interpolation much improved compared to v1.4 or
  - Scale factors and functional form freely choosable a posteriori
 
  Possible table content:
  fastNLO v2 Tables can contain additional contributions like
  - non-perturbative correction factors with uncertainties
    (simple print-out of stored info, available)
  - data points with uncertainties
    (simple print-out of stored info, available)
  - threshold corrections
    (dependence on coupling constants to be evaluated,
     available for inclusive jets)
  - electroweak corrections
    (dependence on coupling constants to be evaluated)
  - new physics contributions
    (dependence on coupling constants to be evaluated)
  - normalization options
    (not used yet)
