ToDo List for FastNLOReader
---------------------------

- LHAPDF name and set
IMPORTANT!!! since LHAPDF is a singleton, you have to crosscheck if the
pdf at accessing time (when you calc xfx) is still the same as when initalizing the
fastNLO reader.
This is always true for simple usages. But if smb might want to compare different pdfs, there
should be some cross check implemented, if you really use the correct LHAPDF.
(safe pdf-name and set for cross checks when returning and recalculating cross sections!!!)

-- future work: fastNLO_toolkit
restructure the code in such a way, that the SAME code/routines/classes/methods are used
for the FastNLOReader, than within common/author/creator directory.
DONE: Now cross check with this code
