  ToDo List for FastNLOReader
-----------------------------

- Implement some 'read fast' switch and 'readfast' PDFLC if
MuF is calculated using only one scale lookup table


- SetPhysUnits.
Availability of changing units afterward in pb, fb, or anything else
+ switch to differential units and divide by the bin size 
=> we would need the dimension of both variables, which define the bin grid
(like GeV and GeV^2 and 1 (for y))
-> just implement some more switch!



- QCDNUM as-evolution
implement the usage of the internal qcdnum as-evolution.


- Printing
Add additional printout for the cross sections, without showing the 
reference cross section!
The reference cross section is actually only valuable for the authors for 
testing and validation of the routines.


- maybe: improve the check if the table exists and 
maybe improve the error handling.


- new iostream -> do we need some 'delete iostream'??



- LHAPDF name and set
IMPORTANT!!! since LHAPDF is a singleton, you have to crosscheck if the
pdf at accessing time (when you calc xfx) is still the same as when initalizing the
fastNLO reader.
This is always true for simpel usages. But if smb might want to compare different pdfs, there
should be some cross check implemented, if you really use the correct LHAPDF.
(safe pdf-name and set for cross checks when returning and recalculating cross sections!!!)



-- future work:
restructure the code in such a way, that the SAME code/routines/classes/methods are used
for the FastNLOReader, than within common/author/creator directory.
