  The fastNLO project provides computer code and tables of pre-computed 
  perturbative coefficients for various observables in hadron-induced 
  processes. 
  This allows very fast computations of these observables for arbitrary PDFs 
  and/or values of alpha_s(Mz) as e.g.
  needed in PDF fits or in systematic studies.
